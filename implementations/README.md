# Implementations

This directory lists known implementations of OCRC components (registries, resolvers, validators). Each implementation may be a submodule or a link.

- [OCRC Python Tools](https://github.com/cryptoinsider1/tools) – validator and ROI generator (in `tools/`).

If you have built an OCRC‑compatible tool, please submit a pull request to add it.

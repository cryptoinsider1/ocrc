# OCRC Development Roadmap

This document outlines the planned evolution of the Open Cooperative Research Protocol.

## Version 1.0 (current)
- Core specification: ROI, RO-Crate profile, OCRC Core Ontology (basic), HDF, GraphQL API.
- Templates for common use cases (FRB event, source, hypothesis).
- Basic validation tools (Python scripts).
- Examples: FRB 180916.J0158+65.

## Version 1.1 (target: Q3 2026)
- Expand ontology with more domain-specific concepts (astro, bio, econ).
- Add more hypothesis patterns.
- Improve tooling: web-based validator, ROI resolver.
- Translations of manifesto (Chinese, Spanish).

## Version 2.0 (future)
- Decentralized identifier resolution (blockchain or distributed hash table).
- Integration with major open science platforms (Zenodo, OSF).
- Automated hypothesis testing workflows.
- Eco-Impact Score implementation.

We welcome community input on these priorities!

# OCRC Profile for RO-Crate

RO-Crate is a lightweight packaging format for research data. This directory defines the OCRC profile, which adds specific requirements and conventions for using RO-Crate within OCRC.

- [specification.md](specification.md) – detailed rules.
- [ocrc-profile.jsonld](ocrc-profile.jsonld) – JSON‑LD context for OCRC.
- [examples/](examples/) – complete example crates.

All OCRC data MUST be packaged as RO-Crate and MUST include at least one ROI in the metadata.

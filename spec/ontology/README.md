# OCRC Core Ontology

The OCRC Core Ontology provides a minimal set of classes and properties for describing research objects. It is written in OWL and available in multiple serializations.

- `ocrc-core.owl` – RDF/XML format.
- `ocrc-core.ttl` – Turtle format.
- `documentation/` – HTML documentation (generated).

The ontology is designed to be extended; domain‑specific ontologies should import this core.

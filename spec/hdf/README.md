# Hypothesis Description Framework (HDF)

HDF is a JSON‑based format for describing scientific hypotheses. It includes fields for the hypothesis statement, testable predictions, falsification conditions, and relationships to other hypotheses.

- `schema/hypothesis_schema.json` – JSON Schema for validation.
- `specification.md` – detailed documentation.
- `examples/` – sample hypotheses.

HDF files should be included in RO-Crates as separate JSON files.

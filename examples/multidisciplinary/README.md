# Multidisciplinary Example

This fictional example combines an astronomical discovery (a new FRB) with an economic impact analysis (how the discovery affects funding). It demonstrates how different domains can share data via OCRC.

- `astro/` – RO‑Crate for the FRB source.
- `econ/` – RO‑Crate for an economic model.
- `link/` – A hypothesis linking the two.

(Not yet implemented – placeholder for future expansion.)

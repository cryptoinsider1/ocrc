# FRB 180916.J0158+65 Example

This example illustrates how to model a known repeating FRB source using OCRC.

- `source/` – RO‑Crate describing the source.
- `events/` – RO‑Crates for two individual bursts.
- `hypotheses/` – HDF file for the orbital hypothesis.

All ROIs are fictional but follow the pattern.

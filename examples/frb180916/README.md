# FRB 180916.J0158+65 Example

This example illustrates how to model a known repeating FRB source using OCRC.

- [source](https://github.com/cryptoinsider1/ocrc/tree/main/examples/frb180916/source) – RO‑Crate describing the source.
- [events](https://github.com/cryptoinsider1/ocrc/tree/main/examples/frb180916/events) – RO‑Crates for two individual bursts.
- [hypotheses](https://github.com/cryptoinsider1/ocrc/tree/main/examples/frb180916/hypotheses) – HDF file for the orbital hypothesis.

All ROIs are fictional but follow the pattern.
